## :page_facing_up: About
- This project is a simple fruits data base built with HTML, CSS, PYTHON and FLASK. There are some people who have issues dealing with sugar consumption. They can generally eat fruits in moderation as part of a balanced diet. This App provides three key values based on 100 grams of the listed fruit, which are sugar, calories and carbohydrates. The App can allow users to be aware of how much sugar and carbohydrates a particular fruit contains.
- Features:
```
1. Sign up/log in functionality.
2. Add your favourite fruits to the data base.
3. Edit/delete the existing fruit in the data base.
4. Search for a specific fruit in the App's data base.
```
- The motivation behind this project was to improve my skills in full-stack web development. I wanted to challenge myself by building an App using HTML, CSS, PYTHON and FLask.
